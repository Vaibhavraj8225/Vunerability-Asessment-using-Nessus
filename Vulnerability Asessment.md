Vulnerability Assessment Report

Prepared By: Vaibhav Raj Sahu
Tool Used: Nessus Essentials, Nmap
Target System: Local network (Mr.Robot Vulnerable Machine From VulnHub)
Report Date: 29-05-2025
1. Introduction
This report documents the process and findings of a basic vulnerability scan using Tenable's Nessus Essentials. The objective was to identify known vulnerabilities within a local test environment, analyze the risks associated with them, and provide recommendations to address the found vulnerabilities.
The scan was performed on a host within a VirtualBox using Kali Linux as the scanner platform. Nessus Essentials, a widely recognized vulnerability scanning tool, was selected due to its comprehensive detection engine, high scan accuracy, and free availability for educational use.

Target Discovery
Using Nmap to identify active hosts: sudo nmap -sn ip_address/24

Confirmed target IP: ip_address
Verified open ports with: sudo nmap ip_address

3. Key Findings
Vulnerability 1: PHP 5.5.x < 5.5.38 Multiple Vulnerabilities (EDB-ID: 40155)
•	Severity: High
•	Description: Multiple vulnerabilities exist in PHP 5.5.x versions prior to 5.5.38, allowing attackers to cause buffer overflows and denial of service without user interaction.
•	Recommendation: Upgrade to PHP 5.5.38 or higher to mitigate multiple CVEs.
•	CVE References: CVE-2015-8879, CVE-2016-5385, CVE-2016-5399, CVE-2016-6207, CVE-2016-6288 - CVE-2016-6297
•	CVSS v3.0 Base Score: 9.8 (Critical)

Vulnerability 2: SSL Certificate Signed Using Weak Hashing Algorithm
•	Severity: Medium
•	Description: The SSL certificate was found to be signed with a weak hashing algorithm (e.g., MD5), making it vulnerable to collisions and impersonation.
•	Recommendation: Replace the certificate with one signed using a strong algorithm such as SHA-256.
•	CVE References: CVE-2004-2761, CVE-2005-4900
•	CVSS v3.0 Base Score: 5.3

Vulnerability 3: OpenSSL AES-NI Padding Oracle MitM Information Disclosure
•	Severity: Low
•	Description: A vulnerability in OpenSSL allows an attacker performing a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack to obtain plaintext from encrypted traffic due to a padding oracle issue.
•	Recommendation: Upgrade OpenSSL to a patched version and ensure secure cipher configuration.
•	CVE Reference: CVE-2016-2107
•	CVSS v3.0 Base Score: 5.9

4. Recommendations
1.	Patch and Update Software
o	Immediately upgrade PHP to version 5.5.38 or higher.
o	Patch OpenSSL to the latest stable version.
2.	Strengthen SSL/TLS Configuration
o	Replace SSL certificates signed with MD5 or other weak hashes.
o	Enforce the use of secure hashing algorithms like SHA-2 or SHA-3.
3.	General Security Enhancements
o	Implement web and service hardening (e.g., restrict services, disable verbose error messages).
o	Limit open ports to essential services only.
o	Deploy host-based firewalls and segment critical services.

5. Conclusion
The vulnerability scan using Nessus Essentials revealed multiple issues with varying severities on the test system. Notably, an outdated PHP version introduces critical security risks, while weak SSL practices pose a medium risk. These findings underscore the importance of regular patching, configuration hardening, and secure development practices.
Immediate remediation of the high-risk vulnerabilities is essential to reduce the attack surface and improve the overall security posture of the system.
